# FLNgenerate_report_button_clicked will be automatically made undefined
# by docassemble when the user clicks the 'Back' button on the next
# screen (or when they restart the interview).
# We also have to ensure FLNstats_email_recipient and FLNstats_email_template
# are defined before sending any emails, otherwise this question's code may
